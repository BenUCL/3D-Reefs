#At isntall I was getting this issue:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++: No such file or directory
clang++-18: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.

##########################
# Fixed with agent mode, 
# Problem: Clang-18 selected GCC-12 but libstdc++-12-dev was not installed
# Solution: sudo apt install -y libstdc++-12-dev
# Clang now compiles successfully!

###########################
# note the rep says ubuntu 22.04 is fine, but this turns out not be the case. It needs 24. something.
# am now upgraidng ubuntu again
# Still had to install GCC-14 (but comes with Ubuntu 24.04 so easy)

#############################
# Now its working, see notes.txt on how to run
# I did have to install UV and make an env with numpy, pycolmap, wilflow and wildflow-splat
