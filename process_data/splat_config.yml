# Splat Training & Cleanup Configuration
# This file contains all paths and parameters for gaussian splatting workflows

# PATHS
paths:
  # Path to LichtFeld-Studio binary
  lichtfeld_bin: /home/ben/encode/code/lichtfeld-studio/build/LichtFeld-Studio
  # Root directory containing all patch folders (p0, p1, p2, ...)
  patches_dir: /home/ben/encode/data/intermediate_data/colmap5/sparse_patches
  # Directory containing source images organized by camera (e.g., images/left/, images/right/)
  images_dir: /home/ben/encode/data/intermediate_data/colmap5/images
  # COLMAP sparse reconstruction directory (contains cameras.bin, images.bin, points3D.bin)
  sparse_dir: /home/ben/encode/data/intermediate_data/colmap5/sparse
  # Optional: Path to dense point cloud PLY for denser initialization (leave empty to use COLMAP points)
  pointcloud_path: 

# PATCHING CONFIGURATION
patching:
  # Maximum cameras per patch
  max_cameras: 400
  # Overlap between patches in meters - use path_visualiser.py to test!
  buffer_meters: 0.1
  # Use COLMAP sparse points (points3D.bin) for initialization (default: true)
  use_colmap_points: true
  # If using external PLY, percentage to sample (default: 5.0, ignored if using COLMAP points)
  #TODO: this is ignored currently if using colmap points3d.bin I believe, fix that?
  sample_percentage: 5.0


# CAMERA CONFIGURATION
# Maps image subfolder names to COLMAP camera IDs
camera_mapping:
  left: 1
  right: 2
  # add more mappings as needed

# TRAINING PARAMETERS
training:
  # Number of training iterations (default: 20000)
  iterations: 15000
  # Maximum gaussians capacity (default: 1000000)
  max_cap: 1000000
  # Pose optimization: 'direct', 'mlp', or 'none' (default: direct)
  pose_opt: direct
  # Optimization strategy: 'mcmc' or 'default' (default: mcmc)
  # NOTE: 'default' required due to LFS bug - MCMC strategy fails on some patches (p5, p6, p12)
  # with "CUDA error: invalid configuration argument" in MulBackward1 during adaptive Gaussian growth.
  # TODO: File bug report with LichtFeld-Studio about MCMC + FastGS incompatibility
  strategy: default
  # Run in headless mode without GUI (default: true)
  headless: true
  # If true, train all patches; if false, train single patch (default: true)
  run_batch: false
  # Patch to train when run_batch=false (default: p0)
  single_patch: p0

# CLEANUP SPLATS PARAMETERS
# NOTE: May want to view some splats output during training first to check for any funny business or failures.
cleanup:
  # Maximum splat area to keep - removes oversized splats (default: 0.004)
  max_area: 0.004
  # Minimum neighbors within radius for a splat to be kept (default: 20)
  min_neighbors: 20
  # Radius in meters for neighbor search (default: 0.1) #TODO: As above, this is not actually conssitant with metres
  radius: 0.05
  # Each patch has a boundary which is stored in their patch_metadata.json. 
  # Set filter_boundaries to true to shrink the boundary, removing splats outside this shrunken boundary.
  filter_boundaries: true
  # If filter_boundaries=true, set the distance by which to shrink each patches boundary. 
  # Commonly it will be that this should match patching.buffer_meters above, so as to trim patches down so there is no overlap between them.
  boundary_buffer: 0.1
  # If true, clean all patches; if false, clean single patch (default: true)
  run_batch: false
  # Patch to clean when run_batch=false (default: p0)
  single_patch: p0
